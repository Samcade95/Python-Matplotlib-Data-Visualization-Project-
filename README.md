# Python-Matplotlib-Data-Visualization-Project-
This is a Python project that I completed using the book from No Starch Press Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Eric Matthes, I used both Python commands and Matplotlib a Data Visualization API built into Python to create interactive Data Visualizations.

This project features Data Visualizations using random walks, dice, and squares to showcase the ability of the Matplotlib API as a built-in Python Extension.
